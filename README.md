# Hi, I'm Buani Doki Engoue ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Junior Data Scientist** with a passion for learning and applying data-driven solutions. I have a solid foundation in:
- **Machine Learning**
- **Statistics**
- **Databases**

I am continuously building my portfolio of projects, applying my skills to solve real-world problems. My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled **Data Scientist**, capable of delivering insights and solutions to complex challenges.

Feel free to explore my projects below to see my progress and the areas I'm focusing on.

## What I'm Working On:

- ðŸ§  Continuously learning through hands-on projects in **supervised and unsupervised learning**, **neural networks**, and **deep learning frameworks** like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- ðŸ“Š Applying statistical techniques such as **hypothesis testing**, **regression analysis**, and **probability distributions** in my work.
- ðŸ¤– Expanding my knowledge in **natural language processing (NLP)** and exploring innovative algorithms.
- ðŸ“ˆI also enjoy **scraping sports data** and creating **visually appealing charts** to tell data-driven stories.
- ðŸ’¡ Always on the lookout for new challenges in data science, staying updated with the latest trends and research papers.


## Data Science Projects


### Speech Emotion Recognition


- Implemented state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature on **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** to analyze emotional patterns in speech data.
- Trained models using audio features extracted with a model that have been trained with **emotion2vec+large** features , leveraging advanced embeddings to improve emotion classification accuracy.

### [Toxic comments classification](https://github.com/buanide/comments_classification)

This was an individual project at Polytech Lille.

- Cleaned the dataset(10 000 lines) by removing null values to enhance data quality and ensure accurate analysis.
- Engineered new features using word embedding techniques to capture semantic relationships in the text data.
- Trained and optimized machine learning models to accurately classify toxic comments, improving the detection of harmful content.

## Data Analysis Projects

### [Scooter Users Satisfaction Project](https://github.com/buanide/Scooter-user-satisfaction)

This was a team project at Polytech Lille involving a group of 6 members.

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 600 scooter users to uncover 4 distinct user segments.
- Performed hypothesis testing to validate key insights and user behaviors.
- Developed and proposed two targeted offers designed to meet the needs of these four user segments, enhancing overall customer satisfaction
